 Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the
 countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts.
  Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove     right at the coast of the Semantics, a large
  language ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with
  the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of
  sentences fly into your mouth. Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the
   blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life One day however
   a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave

   for the far World of Grammar. The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because
   there were thousands of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind
   Text didn’t listen.          She packed her

    she had a last view back    on the skyline of her hometown
  Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet Village and the subline of her own
  road, the Line Lane. Pityful a rethoric question ran over her cheek, then she continued her way.
   On her way she met a copy.
  The copy warned the Little Blind Text, that where it came from it

  word "and" and the Little Blind Text should turn around and return to its own, safe country. But nothing the copy
  said could convince her and so it didn’t take long until a few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with
  Longe and Parole and dragged her into their agency, where they abused her for
   their projects again and again. And if she hasn’t been rewritten, then 14 14.5 15 15.5 16 16.5 17
